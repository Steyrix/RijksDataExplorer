A simple showcase application for Rijks Museum which is designed to demonstrate modern 
approaches on building Android applications. Uses MVI architecture pattern, Jetpack Compose, Kotlin 
Coroutines, Retrofit, Dagger Hilt.


## Things for which I had no time (but I would implement them if I had enough):
- Unit tests for Composable functions
- Full test coverage for view models
- UI tests. Actually, the problem was that Espresso framework does not support Compose projects.
- TopAppBar for Item Details screen with "Back" button.
